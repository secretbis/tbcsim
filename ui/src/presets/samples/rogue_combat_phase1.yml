# theres only about 2% difference between 3s/3r, 3s/5r, 4s/5r, 5s/5r or other combinations, doesn't seem to matter much.
# 3s/3r seems to sim the best.
# completely replacing rupture with eviscerate is also only about 1%, if no Mangle is present on the target.
# using shiv when a 5 stack deadly poison stack is about to drop seems to be a very slight dps *loss*
